==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

A Fiori Elements application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their to-many associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the to-many associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

You help the user refining the DataModel for a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The DataModel consists of the following entities and associations:

The user input below describes the details of the ListReport page (i.e. its filters, tables or views with their columns).

Your task is to help the user defining the ListReport page.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

The user input below describes a Fiori Elements Application with the following pages:
 - ListReport page for "FruitSizeProfiles"
 - ObjectPage for "FruitSizeProfiles"
 - ObjectPage for "FreshFruitWeightSamples"

Your task is to find the details of the ObjectPage for "FruitSizeProfiles".
The base entity of the ObjectPage is FruitSizeProfiles.
This ObjectPage can contain tabs and/or sections which in turn contain tables and fields.
It must contain table sections containing data for associated entity "FreshFruitWeightSamples" (via association freshFruitWeightSamples);

The underlying data model allows the following propertyPaths:
 - country: Country (of Fruit Size Profile)
 - cultivar: Cultivar (of Fruit Size Profile)
 - fruitSizeWeightBand: Fruit Size Weight Band (of Fruit Size Profile)
 - totalFruitPieces: Total Fruit Pieces (of Fruit Size Profile)
 - averageFruitSize: Average Fruit Size (of Fruit Size Profile)
 - cropFruitSizeProfileGraph: Crop Fruit Size Profile Graph (of Fruit Size Profile)
 - freshFruitWeightSamples/freshFruitWeightSamples: Fresh Fruit Weight Samples (of many associated Fresh Fruit Weight Sample)
 - freshFruitWeightSamples/averageFreshFruitWeight: Average Fresh Fruit Weight (of many associated Fresh Fruit Weight Sample)

==========LLM call for step "extractColors":==========
You help the user creating a Fiori Elements application based on user input describing such an application.
Your task is to determine whether the entity properties can be considered good and bad in most contexts or are usually neutral. When in doubt, set to neutral.

These are the entity properties and their values:
Entity: FruitSizeProfiles, Property: country, Values: New Zealand, France, Italy, South Korea, Japan
Entity: FruitSizeProfiles, Property: cultivar, Values: Gold3, Hayward, Red19

If the properties can be considered good and bad, the allowed values for their criticality and the associated colors are:
   negative: red
   critical: yellow or orange
   positive: green
   neutral:  grey

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "FruitSizeProfiles" - Properties:
    country: String(50), Dropdown: New Zealand, France, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Mandatory
    cultivar: String(50), Dropdown: Gold3, Hayward, Red19, Mandatory
    fruitSizeWeightBand: Decimal, Calculated, Numeric
    totalFruitPieces: Integer, Calculated, Numeric
    averageFruitSize: Decimal, Calculated, Numeric
    cropFruitSizeProfileGraph: String(50), Calculated, Graph

Entity "FreshFruitWeightSamples" - Properties:
    freshFruitWeightSamples: String(255), Comma-separated or list of fruit weights in grams, Mandatory
    averageFreshFruitWeight: Decimal, Calculated, Numeric
    fruitSizeProfiles_country: String(50), country of associated FruitSizeProfiles

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"FruitSizeProfiles.csv":"country;cultivar;fruitSizeWeightBand;totalFruitPieces;averageFruitSize;cropFruitSizeProfileGraph","FreshFruitWeightSamples.csv":"freshFruitWeightSamples;averageFreshFruitWeight;fruitSizeProfiles_country"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  Decimal(3,2): 1.23
  Integer, Double: only numbers, no special symbols
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
    
For the following fields, use only the supplied allowed values (as they are, don't insert spaces or change case):
- country (of FruitSizeProfiles): NewZealand, France, Italy, SouthKorea, Japan
- cultivar (of FruitSizeProfiles): Gold3, Hayward, Red19
