You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

A Fiori Elements application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their to-many associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the to-many associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

I want to develop an SAP Fiori application that fulfills the requirements outlined in the following user story:  
    Description: As a grower or agricultural personnel, I need to calculate thinning weight for fruits based on various parameters and validate input fields for accuracy.  
    Thinning Calculator App:  
    Fields:  
    Country (Dropdown: France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Key, Mandatory),  
    Variety (Dropdown: SunGold, Green, RubyRed, Key, Mandatory),  
    Date_FullBloom (Date, Mandatory),

    Thinning_Weight (Numeric).  
    Selection Fields: Country, Variety, Target_SizeRemove

Processing Logic:  
    1. Validate input fields:  
        - Ensure Fruit Variety exists in the Fruit Variety Master for the selected Country.  
        - Validate Date of Full Bloom against the Bloom start and end dates.  
        - Validate Date of Thinning against the Growth Curve Master.  
        - Validate Date of Harvest against the Growth Curve Master.  
        - Ensure Target Size to Remove exists in the Fruit Sizes Values Master for the selected Country and Variety.  
    2. Calculate Thinning Weight:  
        - Determine DFB_HARVEST_days: Days between Date of Full Bloom and Date of Harvest.  
        - Lookup FW_Constant for DFB_HARVEST_days from Growth Curve Master.  
        - Determine DFB_THINNING_days: Days between Date of Full Bloom and Date of Thinning.  
        - Lookup FW_Constant for DFB_THINNING_days from Growth Curve Master.  
        - Lookup Maximum Weight Band for Target Size to Remove from Fruit Sizes Values Master.  
        - Formula: Thinning Weight = MaximumWeightBand / (DFB_HARVEST_FW / DFB_THINNING_FW).  
    3. Error Handling:  
        - Invalid Fruit Variety: "Invalid Fruit Variety. Please choose a valid Fruit Variety."  
        - Invalid Date of Full Bloom: "The Date of Full Bloom must be between the following Bloom dates D1 and D2."  
        - Invalid Date of Thinning: "The Date of Thinning must be between (N1) & (N2) for Variety V."  
        - Invalid Date of Harvest: "The Date of Harvest must be between X & (N2) for Variety V."  
        - Missing Target Fruit Size: "Missing Target Fruit Size - Thin Target Size values."  
    Additionally, I need the ability to create, update, and delete functionality.

You help the user refining the DataModel for a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The DataModel consists of the following entities and associations:
- entity "ThinningCalculations" (with to-many associations to "FruitVarietyMasters" and "GrowthCurveMasters" and "FruitSizesValuesMasters")
- entity "FruitVarietyMasters" (with to-one association to "ThinningCalculations")
- entity "GrowthCurveMasters" (with to-one association to "ThinningCalculations")
- entity "FruitSizesValuesMasters" (with to-one association to "ThinningCalculations")

Your task is to find the properties for each entity.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}

For each property analyze the description with respect to what property values can be expected.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

<UserInput>
I want to develop an SAP Fiori application that fulfills the requirements outlined in the following user story:
Description: As a grower or agricultural personnel, I need to calculate thinning weight for fruits based on various parameters and validate input fields for accuracy.

    Thinning Calculator App:  
    Fields:  
    Country (Dropdown: France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Key, Mandatory),  
    Variety (Dropdown: SunGold, Green, RubyRed, Key, Mandatory),  
    Date_FullBloom (Date, Mandatory),  
    Date_Thinning (Date, Mandatory),  
    Date_Harvest (Date, Mandatory),  
Target_SizeRemove (Dropdown: Gold3: 36, 39 (NSS), 42 (NSS), Undersized; Hayward: 39, 42, 46 (NSS), Undersized; Red19: 42, 46 (NSS), 49 (NSS), Undersized, Mandatory),
    Thinning_Weight (Numeric).  
    Selection Fields: Country, Variety, Target_SizeRemove

Processing Logic:  
    1. Validate input fields:  
        - Ensure Fruit Variety exists in the Fruit Variety Master for the selected Country.  
        - Validate Date of Full Bloom against the Bloom start and end dates.  
        - Validate Date of Thinning against the Growth Curve Master.  
        - Validate Date of Harvest against the Growth Curve Master.  
- Ensure Target Size to Remove exists in the Fruit Sizes Values Master for the selected Country and Variety.

    2. Calculate Thinning Weight:  
        - Determine DFB_HARVEST_days: Days between Date of Full Bloom and Date of Harvest.  
        - Lookup FW_Constant for DFB_HARVEST_days from Growth Curve Master.  
        - Determine DFB_THINNING_days: Days between Date of Full Bloom and Date of Thinning.  
        - Lookup FW_Constant for DFB_THINNING_days from Growth Curve Master.  
        - Lookup Maximum Weight Band for Target Size to Remove from Fruit Sizes Values Master.  
        - Formula: Thinning Weight = MaximumWeightBand / (DFB_HARVEST_FW / DFB_THINNING_FW).  
    3. Error Handling:  
        - Invalid Fruit Variety: "Invalid Fruit Variety. Please choose a valid Fruit Variety."  
- Invalid Date of Full Bloom: "The Date of Full Bloom must be between the following Bloom dates D1 and D2."
- Invalid Date of Thinning: "The Date of Thinning must be between (N1) & (N2) for Variety V."
        - Invalid Date of Harvest: "The Date of Harvest must be between X & (N2) for Variety V."  
        - Missing Target Fruit Size: "Missing Target Fruit Size - Thin Target Size values."  
    Additionally, I need the ability to create, update, and delete functionality.

The user input below describes the details of the ListReport page (i.e. its filters, tables or views with their columns).

Your task is to help the user defining the ListReport page.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

==========LLM call for step "extractSingleObjectPageOfMany":==========
The user input below describes a Fiori Elements Application with the following pages:
 - ListReport page for "ThinningCalculations"
 - ObjectPage for "ThinningCalculations"

Your task is to find the details of the ObjectPage for "ThinningCalculations".
The base entity of the ObjectPage is ThinningCalculations.
This ObjectPage can contain tabs and/or sections which in turn contain tables and fields.
It must contain table sections containing data for:
 - associated entity "FruitVarietyMasters" (via association fruitVarietyMaster)
 - associated entity "GrowthCurveMasters" (via association growthCurveMaster)
 - associated entity "FruitSizesValuesMasters" (via association fruitSizesValuesMaster);

The underlying data model allows the following propertyPaths:
 - country: Country (of Thinning Calculation)
 - variety: Variety (of Thinning Calculation)
 - dateFullBloom: Date Full Bloom (of Thinning Calculation)
 - dateThinning: Date Thinning (of Thinning Calculation)
 - dateHarvest: Date Harvest (of Thinning Calculation)
 - targetSizeRemove: Target Size Remove (of Thinning Calculation)
 - thinningWeight: Thinning Weight (of Thinning Calculation)
 - fruitVarietyMaster/fruitVariety: Fruit Variety (of many associated Fruit Variety Master)

Entity: ThinningCalculations, Property: variety, Values: SunGold, Green, RubyRed
Entity: ThinningCalculations, Property: targetSizeRemove, Values: Gold3: 36, Gold3: 39 (NSS), Gold3: 42 (NSS), Gold3: Undersized, Hayward: 39, Hayward: 42, Hayward: 46 (NSS), Hayward: Undersized, Red19: 42, Red19: 46 (NSS), Red19: 49 (NSS), Red19: Undersized

If the properties can be considered good and bad, the allowed values for their criticality and the associated colors are:
   negative: red
   critical: yellow or orange
   positive: green
   neutral:  grey

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

<UserInput>
I want to develop an SAP Fiori application that fulfills the requirements outlined in the following user story:  
    Description: As a grower or agricultural personnel, I need to calculate thinning weight for fruits based on various parameters and validate input fields for accuracy.  
    Thinning Calculator App:  
    Fields:  
    Country (Dropdown: France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Key, Mandatory),  
    Variety (Dropdown: SunGold, Green, RubyRed, Key, Mandatory),  
    Date_FullBloom (Date, Mandatory),  
    Date_Thinning (Date, Mandatory),  
    Date_Harvest (Date, Mandatory),  
    Target_SizeRemove (Dropdown: Gold3: 36, 39 (NSS), 42 (NSS), Undersized; Hayward: 39, 42, 46 (NSS), Undersized; Red19: 42, 46 (NSS), 49 (NSS), Undersized, Mandatory),  
    Thinning_Weight (Numeric).  
    Selection Fields: Country, Variety, Target_SizeRemove

Processing Logic:  
    1. Validate input fields:  
        - Ensure Fruit Variety exists in the Fruit Variety Master for the selected Country.  
        - Validate Date of Full Bloom against the Bloom start and end dates.  
        - Validate Date of Thinning against the Growth Curve Master.  
        - Validate Date of Harvest against the Growth Curve Master.  
        - Ensure Target Size to Remove exists in the Fruit Sizes Values Master for the selected Country and Variety.  
    2. Calculate Thinning Weight:  
        - Determine DFB_HARVEST_days: Days between Date of Full Bloom and Date of Harvest.  
        - Lookup FW_Constant for DFB_HARVEST_days from Growth Curve Master.  
        - Determine DFB_THINNING_days: Days between Date of Full Bloom and Date of Thinning.  
        - Lookup FW_Constant for DFB_THINNING_days from Growth Curve Master.  
        - Lookup Maximum Weight Band for Target Size to Remove from Fruit Sizes Values Master.  
        - Formula: Thinning Weight = MaximumWeightBand / (DFB_HARVEST_FW / DFB_THINNING_FW).  
    3. Error Handling:  
        - Invalid Fruit Variety: "Invalid Fruit Variety. Please choose a valid Fruit Variety."  
        - Invalid Date of Full Bloom: "The Date of Full Bloom must be between the following Bloom dates D1 and D2."  
        - Invalid Date of Thinning: "The Date of Thinning must be between (N1) & (N2) for Variety V."  
        - Invalid Date of Harvest: "The Date of Harvest must be between X & (N2) for Variety V."  
        - Missing Target Fruit Size: "Missing Target Fruit Size - Thin Target Size values."  
    Additionally, I need the ability to create, update, and delete functionality.

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "ThinningCalculations" - Properties:
    country: String(50), Dropdown: France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea; Key, Mandatory
    variety: String(50), Dropdown: SunGold, Green, RubyRed; Key, Mandatory
    dateFullBloom: Date, Mandatory; Validate against Bloom start and end dates
    dateThinning: Date, Mandatory; Validate against Growth Curve Master
    dateHarvest: Date, Mandatory; Validate against Growth Curve Master
    targetSizeRemove: String(50), Dropdown: Gold3: 36, 39 (NSS), 42 (NSS), Undersized; Hayward: 39, 42, 46 (NSS), Undersized; Red19: 42, 46 (NSS), 49 (NSS), Undersized; Mandatory
    thinningWeight: Decimal, Calculated field; Numeric

Entity "FruitVarietyMasters" - Properties:
    fruitVariety: String(50), Ensure Fruit Variety exists for the selected Country
    thinningCalculations_country: String(50), country of associated ThinningCalculations

Entity "GrowthCurveMasters" - Properties:
    growthCurveId: String(50), Used for validating Date of Thinning and Date of Harvest
    thinningCalculations_country: String(50), country of associated ThinningCalculations

Entity "FruitSizesValuesMasters" - Properties:
    fruitSizeValue: String(50), Ensure Target Size to Remove exists for the selected Country and Variety
    thinningCalculations_country: String(50), country of associated ThinningCalculations

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"ThinningCalculations.csv":"country;variety;dateFullBloom;dateThinning;dateHarvest;targetSizeRemove;thinningWeight","FruitVarietyMasters.csv":"fruitVariety;thinningCalculations_country","GrowthCurveMasters.csv":"growthCurveId;thinningCalculations_country","FruitSizesValuesMasters.csv":"fruitSizeValue;thinningCalculations_country"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
  Date: 2021-06-27
  Decimal(3,2): 1.23
    
For the following fields, use only the supplied allowed values (as they are, don't insert spaces or change case):
- variety (of ThinningCalculations): SunGold, Green, RubyRed
- targetSizeRemove (of ThinningCalculations): Gold3:36, Gold3:39(NSS), Gold3:42(NSS), Gold3:Undersized, Hayward:39, Hayward:42, Hayward:46(NSS), Hayward:Undersized, Red19:42, Red19:46(NSS), Red19:49(NSS), Red19:Undersized
